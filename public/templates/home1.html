<p><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Main purpose of this application:</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Datasets of soil moisture (like Staringreeks and BOFEK) &nbsp;can be investigated from a geostatistical point of view in relation to spatial soil profile distribution in different predominant soil moisture conditions. This can be used to access spatial soil moisture patterns and confidently evaluate the <strong>minimal number of soil moisture sensors for a given area.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">After the homogenous soil moisture areas are mapped, these areas can be identified as management zones and managed independently for irrigation based on soil moisture and crop water requirements. For those areas, <strong>the fixed soil moisture sensors could be used to periodically monitor soil moisture or for irrigation systems.</strong></span></p>

<p>Using the textural composition of the test soil, viz. percentage sand, percentage clay, percentage silt and in some cases the percentage of organic matter, a soil is assigned a soil texture class of the Staringreeks database.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Staringreeks</strong></span><br />
<br />
The &#39;Staringreeks&#39; was derived using a collection of soil-physical characteristics measured on 832 individual soil samples collected in the Netherlands. In Alterra report 153 (W&ouml;sten et al., 2001) on water retention and hydraulic characteristics of soils and subsoils in The Netherlands, soil samples were assigned to one of eighteen texture classes (also called building blocks, coded B1 to B18), using the Dutch soil classification system (De Bakker and Schelling, 1989). Since water retention characteristics for each soil sample are known, a class pedotransfer function for each soil texture class can be calculated. This collection of transfer functions, split in top soils and subsoils, is called the &#39;Staringreeks&#39;.<br />

<h2>How to use this app</h2>

<br />
<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px">IMPORTANT: </span></strong><span style="font-size:18px">Here we are using Well-known text (WKT) representation of coordinate reference systems - EPSG:28992 Projected coordinate system for Netherlands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">If you want to use the conventional GPS system, you will need to use the Web App through a .kml file, as explained below.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:16px">How to get a&nbsp;.kml file?</strong></p>

<p><br />
1) Go to <a href="https://earth.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Earth</a> (https://earth.google.com/).<br />
2) Go to "Search".<br />
3) Enter two coordinates (longitude and latitude) of some point on the farm. This coordinate can be found easily using a smartphone.<br />
4) Click &quot;Draw lines or shapes&quot; at the bottom left of Google Earth.<br />
5) After drawing the lines of the farm, click on &quot;Save Project&quot;, then &quot;New Project&quot; and choose the name that best suits you. Click &quot;Save&quot;.<br />
6) A new box will appear automatically. Give your polygon a name.<br />
7) In your project (which you just named) click on the &quot;three dots&quot; at the top right of the tab and click on &quot;Export as KML file&quot;.<br />
8) Ready, now just save on your computer or celluar and then insert in the appropriate place in the tab &quot;Soil Map - Complete&quot; in our App.<br />
<br />
By doing this, you will be able to access the following data:<br />
<br />
1) Soil data informations, according to BOFEK2020, BOFEK2022 and Staringreeks.<br />
2) Map with the farm&#39;s soil profiles.<br />
4) Indication of how many sensors will be needed in the farm farm.<br />
5) Information on water capacity and limits for the given farm.<br />
<br />

<span style="font-size:16px"><strong>MODULE 1</strong></span><br />
<br />
- Soil texture characterisation is given: %sand, %silt, %clay and %o.m.<br />
- Moisture content is given as x% of MWHC or 75% of field capacity.<br />
- MWHC and field capacity of the test soil are not given.<br />
<br />
1. Enter the percentages sand, silt, clay and organic matter in Module 1 of the App. In the Output box, your soil has now been assigned a soil texture class.<br />
2. The other modules of the App can not be used.<br />
3. Use this Table (Staringreeks) to look up the tabulated pF value at the intersection of the soil texture class (rows) as assigned in Module 1 of the App (description under point 1), and the actual moisture content at which the test soil is brought (columns).<br />
<br />

<hr />
<hr />

<span style="font-size:16px"><strong>MODULE 2</strong></span></p>

<p><br />
- Soil texture characterisation is given: %sand, %silt, %clay and %o.m.<br />
- MWHC (maximum water holding capacity) of the test soil is given.<br />
- Moisture content is given as x% of MWHC.<br />
<br />
1. Enter the percentages of sand, silt, clay and organic matter in Module 1 of the App. In the Output box of Module 1, your soil has now been assigned a soil texture class.<br />
2. In Module 2 of the App, fill in the MWHC of the test soil, expressed as a percentage.<br />
3. In the next cell (list box), select whether this MWHC is expressed in w/w units (gravimetric water content) or in v/v units (volumetric water content). Select a value from the list.<br />
4. In the next cell (list box), select the pF value at which the MWHC is determined. The default value is pF 1. Select a value from the list.<br />
5. Enter the MWHC (in %) to which the test soil is moisturised.<br />
6. If the MWHC is reported as a gravimetric water content (in w/w units), the dry bulk density of the test soil should be entered in Module 2. If this value is not reported, the cell should be cleared and a default value of 1.5 kg.dm-3 will be used in the calculation.<br />
7. In the Output cell of Module 2, the pF of the test soil at &theta;act (actual moisture content) is shown.<br />
<br />

<span style="font-size:16px"><strong>MODULE 3</strong></span></p>

<p><br />
- Soil texture characterisation is given: %sand, %silt, %clay and %o.m.<br />
- MWHC is given.<br />
- Moisture content is given as 75% of field capacity.<br />
<br />
1. Enter the percentages of sand, silt, clay and organic matter in Module 1 of the App. In the Output box of Module 1, your soil has now been assigned a soil texture class.<br />
2. Skip Module 2 and go to Module 3. In Module 3 of the App, enter the field capacity &theta;fc (moisture content at field capacity). The field capacity is a moisture content, it should be entered here in %.<br />
4. In the next cell (list box), select whether this field capacity is expressed in w/w units (gravimetric water content) or in v/v units (volumetric water content). Select a value from the list.<br />
5. In the Output cell of Module 3, the pF of the test soil at 3/4 of field capacity is shown.<br />
<br />

<span style="font-size:16px"><strong>MODULE 4</strong></span></p>

<p><br />
(Calculation of moisture content at given pF)<br />
- Soil texture characterisation is given: %sand, %silt, %clay and %o.m.<br />
- pF is given.<br />
<br />
Module 4 in the App offers the possibility to calculate moisture content at a given pF for the soil texture class selected in Module 1. This procedure is in fact an automated &lsquo;reading off the pF curve&rsquo;. The procedure is not needed for evaluation of studies, but might be useful to gain insight in the shape of the class transfer function used. The Output in this module is moisture content, &theta;(h), in v/v units.</p>
